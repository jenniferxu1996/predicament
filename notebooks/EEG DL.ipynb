FYI, every lines of the Excel file is a sample, and the columns can be regarded as features, e.g., 4096 columns mean 64 channels X 64 time points. Later, the models will reshape 4096 columns into a Matrix with the shape 64 channels X 64 time points. You should can change the number of columns to fit your own needs, e.g., the real dimension of your own Dataset.\n",

    "5. Read evaluation criterias (through iterations) via the [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard). You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/tensorboard-tutorial.html). When you finished training the model, you will find the \"events.out.tfevents.***\" in the folder, e.g., \"/Users/shuyuej/Desktop/trained_model/\".

    "6. Finally, draw beautiful paper photograph using Matlab or Python. Please follow [these scripts](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/tree/master/Draw_Photos).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notice\n",
    "1. I have tested all the files (Python and Matlab) under the macOS. Be advised that for some Matlab files, several Matlab functions are different between Windows Operating System (OS) and macOS. For example, I used \"readmatrix\" function to read CSV files in the MacOS. However, I have to use “csvread” function in the Windows because there was no such \"readmatrix\" Matlab function in the Windows. If you have met similar problems, I recommend you to Google or Baidu them. You can definitely work them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the GCNs-Net (GCN Model), for the graph Convolutional layer, the dimensionality of the graph will be unchanged, and for the max-pooling layer, the dimensionality of the graph will be reduced by 2. That means, if you have N X N graph Laplacian, after the max-pooling layer, the dimension will be N/2 X N/2. If you have a 15-channel EEG system, it cannot use max-pooling unless you selected 14 --> 7 or 12 --> 6 --> 3 or 10 --> 5 or 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1, etc. The details can be reviewed from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08924).\n",

Please edit the [main-GCN.py file](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL/blob/master/Models/main-GCN.py). For example, if you want to implement the GCNs-Net to a 10-channel EEG system, you have to set \"levels\" equal to 1 or 0 because there is at most only one max-pooling (10 --> 5). And you can change argument \"level\" to 1 or 0 to see the difference.\n",
